# CAR_PURCHASING_DATA Project Using Multiple Linear Regression

In This Repo I am completely posting the Data Preprocessing on structure Data. Since Data Preprocessing was one of the most challenging task for many of the ML Engineers I came-up with this repo to share all the important techniques which are usefull to clean the data.

# Steps to follow for developing Ml Models

    - Data collecting 
    - Selecting Required Packages 
    - Handling NUll values for Numerical and Categorical data 
    - converting Categorical_data features to Numerical features
    - Selecting the Best Features for the Model
    - This techniques come under Feature Selection                          
    - Developing few Model
    - Selecting Best model to get better performances on test data  
    - Saving the Model
